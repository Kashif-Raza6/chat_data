gin, ‘King Theodore of Corsica’, but once upon a time there were many curious
names for gin, such as Madame Genever, Diddle, Crank, Hearts Ease, Cats Water,
Lighting, Daffy, to name but a few! Taking the idea of a gin for the King of
Corsica as jumping off point decided to create a gin inspired by the botanicals
of Corsica and the surrounding Mediterranean area. Joining the classic set of
botanicals that use for Portobello Road London Dry Gin, also added, bergamot,
rosemary, basil and green olive, and like with Portobello's Navy Gin just a
tiny pinch of sea salt after distillation to give it that slight hint of
coastal air., On the nose, this gin is exactly what you’d expect from both the
name, the packaging and the list of botanicals, it’s still clearly gin, lots of
juniper lots of citrus, but it is those delightful herbal notes from the basil
and particularly the rosemary., In the mouth hits bright and
vibrant, again with a nice dry finish, perhaps a little less spicy in
flavour than some of the other gins but still with that lingering nutmeg heat,
and like with the navy strength that tint hit of salt leaves you wanting
more and the green olive gives us a lingering sense of dryness., It transports you to the heady

fruitiness to the palate. Lemons and Coriander add layers of fresh citrus

variety of floral tones. Finally, Bay, Thyme and Rosemary add a finely balanced
herbaceous character to the blend.<o:p></o:p>, The various
components bring a softness to a classic core, making this gin round enough to

curious gin from Monkey 47, produced in Germany's Schwartzwald – also known as

botanicals. This medley of ingredients includes fruits and herbs that are
native to the Black Forest, as well as exotic Asian botanicals, including
elderberries, mint, almonds, jasmine, ginger, Vervain and chamomile, to name a
few. Understandably complex, the palate finds a delicate balance between notes
of juniper, citrus, sweet flowers, bitter fruit and peppery spices that lends
itself well to use in cocktails such as Martinis and Gimlets, as well as being
mixed with tonic and garnished with a slice of orange., Appearance: Clear with a silvery, glycerous appearance.<o:p></o:p>, Aroma: Crisp and fresh on the nose. The initial perfumed
burst is of sweet berry / juniper and assorted fresh citrus peel; further
aeration releases pine needle, lavender and clove-like scents. Distinctive and
somewhat unconventional, some tasters found the aromatics a little cologne
like.<o:p></o:p>, Taste: On the palate, this begins soft and glycerous,
gradually building intensity, climaxing in an explosion of peppers; mid palate
is off dry and oily with juniper, lavender, pine needle and spice. Some tangy
notes in the mouth add extra freshness to the traditional characters. Fairly
complex.<o:p></o:p>, Finish: Good balance of all components and racy, fresh
finish, flavors persisting into the long, dry after taste."

smells and colors and, a great Gin lover, he decided to produce, in the family
distillery, his version of the famous white distillate. From the savoir faire
of Domaine du Coquerel was born the Gin Normindia, 100% artisan which, in the
balance between softness, sweetness and spiciness, pays homage to the land that
inspired it. Produced by 15 botanicals, of which 8 are declared, Normindia is
distilled in the same still used for Calvados and is a very special Gin that
tends to appeal to the most curious palates., An incisive
nose of apple, orange peel in alcohol and cinnamon, then opens to deeper and
balsamic tones of juniper and cloves, with a hint of ginger and white pepper.

persistence from the infinite thing of ginger."

Spanish oak sherry quarter casks, which sounds thoroughly delicious. It's
bottled without any additional colouring, or any of that chill-filtration,
too.  Oh, and the name? If you hadn't miraculously worked it out already,
Aerolite Lyndsay is in fact an anagram of the words ‘ten year old Islay’! See

was first introduced back in 2006 when the company released its first 4-year-old
sourced whiskey, which was based on a nearly century-old recipe developed by
Alphonse Kerkhof in Templeton, Iowa. Templeton Rye 6-Year Rye Whiskey was
distilled from a recipe of 95% rye and 5% barley at MGP in Lawrenceburg,
Indiana. Following its first release, the company quickly experienced its fair
share of controversy after the company was the subject of a class-action
lawsuit over alleged deceptive marketing practices. The 6-year expression,
which was first released in 2016, is also distilled from the same recipe by MGP
and the juice is sent to Templeton, Iowa, where the company adds their own
proprietary formula and local purified water before bottling the whiskey at
their facility., Color:
Light Copper., Nose:
The nose is relatively simple, delivering the obvious rye spice that is
expected from a 95% MGP rye, some dry herbal notes, along with notes of sweet
caramel, vanilla, some toasted coconut, and a touch of smoky oak., Palate:
This rye has a relatively light mouthfeel and there is minimal rye spice and
heat on the palate. Instead, the palate is dominated mostly by sweet notes,
including vanilla, caramel, some crisp green apple, baking spice, and smoky
oak., Finish:
The finish is undoubtedly the best part of this rye. It is medium-long with a
nice combination of alcohol burn and rye spice. The heavier spicy notes are
balanced by the sweetness of caramel, maraschino cherry, dry oak, and a few
dill-like herbal notes that finish out the pour."

modern winemaking dates from the 17th century and was handed down by able monks
from the Carthusian monastery in Bordeaux, who had acquired considerable talent
as viticulturists and winemakers. The people who produce the wine in the 21st
century have inherited these time-honored methods, adding just the right amount
of innovation and modernity to make the utmost of the outstanding terroir. La

subjected to a gradual transformation through contact with air and wood. This
results in considerable evaporation and concentration, with approximately 35%
of the original volume of a 20-year-old tawny disappearing before it is
eventually bottled. Constant attention is needed as maturing barrels and vats
of varied sizes will show marked differences as they age. The master blender,
cellar master and coopers all play their parts in nurturing the maturing wines
until finally a beautifully balanced aged tawny Port emerges. Dow’s Aged
Tawnies have a singular identity which strives to balance the proportion of
wood character with the original fine fruit flavours. To achieve this style,
the Dow’s tasters have traditionally aged a proportion of their ageing tawnies
in the larger well-seasoned oak balseiros, with capacities ranging from 5,000
to 10,000 <span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">liters<span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">. The result is that the Dow’s Aged Tawnies retain an
attractive fruit character and lose less intensity over the years, with a
deeper colour than most. This, combined with the hallmark drier style of Dow’s,
creates unique Ports with a distinctive style, Dow’s 20-Year-Old is the perfect example of an aged tawny

characteristics from prolonged wood-ageing., With a polished brown centre and orangeamber edges, this

butterfly “Charaxes jasius” is particularly common on the Tyrrhenian coast,
mainly on the Tuscan side, where it has found its ideal habitat. It is commonly
known under the most romantic name of “Nymph of the Strawberry Tree” because it
lives in the woods where those plants are and of which leaves and fruits it
feeds on. Farmers, however, know this butterfly with a different name, the
“drunken butterfly” or, more simply, “the boozer” for its habit of going to the
vineyards to suck the sugary and tasty grapes. A greedy habit, they were of
precious help to the farmers who knew in that way when the grapes were ripe and
ready for harvest. The sense of freedom and lightness that this story recalls are
the same that you get when you taste Ninfato, a Sangiovese made as per ancient
Tuscan methods with limited presence of sulfites, an authentic wine that is

prices from its privileged position between the Andes and the Pacific, where
winemakers are blessed with some of the most desirable conditions on earth:
exceptional soils, ideal temperatures, intense sunlight. There is very little
use of pesticide and the philosophy of the winemakers we work with is: minimal
interference. We work closely with a handful of the finest winemakers in Chile.
We source Vina Edmara from two main areas: the rich Central Valley area and the
cooler Coastal Area. All exhibit the maximum-freshness fruit for which Chile is
famous. Vina Edmara wines reflect Chile and the typicity of each of the
varietals and of their terroir., The grapes were handpicked, destemmed, crushed and chilled
quickly to preserve the aromatics and varietal flavors. They were pressed and
the musts were then separated into different qualities in accordance with the
amount of pressure exerted during the crush. The juice was clarified at 8°C by
decantation and then fermented in stainless steel tanks at low temperatures of
14°C., This lively young wine has a vibrant flavour with
luscious tropical notes and delicate undertones of wood giving complexity.
Balanced acidity sustains the taste and gives freshness to the palate."
